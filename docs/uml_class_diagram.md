There are 5 main classes that are very connected in our website. This includes StudySpaces which include all content regarding a studySpace such as title, photo, location, operating hours, whether its on campus or not, and a description. Then there are StudySessions that all have a connected StudySpace plus more info such as the host of the study session, the date for the study session, a description for study session and participants for that study session. Next there are users that have basic user information such as username, passwords, email and their first and last names. These users can leave comments and reviews (comments not implemented yet). The reviews include basic info such as a rating (out of 5 stars), a description, and the author and studyspace attached to the review. Comments will have more simple information of a message and the study session the comment is for and what users made the comment and the date.
